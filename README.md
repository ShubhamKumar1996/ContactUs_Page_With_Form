# ContactUs_Page_With_Form
A Simple Contact us page with a form to take input from User and send it to the Backend. A Query List is to list down all the queries of students.

# Motivation
Just want to dig HTML and Node.js as much as i can, so that i can get deeper knowledge of them.

# Lesson Learned
Working on this project taught me several different things: -

1. Importance of External CSS file :- As my web page come to end i noticed that each html tag has atleast 5 to 6 attributes associated with it and that became pretty scary when look it from a distance.

2. Importance of Web Framework :- I Tried to write whole backend code with Node.js only without using any framework and again after some time it become really difficult and time consuming for me to continue. For Example :- I got stuck in extracting request body from request and i googled it but it took so much of my time and still i am not able to find the solution. That where i started using Express.js Framework and things become quit easy. That's where i learnt importance of Framework.

# Tools and Techology Utilized
1. HTML :- Created whole frontend of the web page.
2. Node.js :- Written whole server-side code using it.
3. Express.js :- Node.js based framework, made web development pretty easy.
4. MongoDB :- Database for storing and retrieving all the Student Queries.
5. Mongoose :- ODM (Object Document Mapping Tool) allow us to focus more on backend logic instead of writting queries for CRUD functionality.
